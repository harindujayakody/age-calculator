## How it Works

The Age Calculator is built using Python and relies on a few components to provide accurate age calculations. Here's how it works and the components it utilizes:

### Python Script

The core of the Age Calculator is a Python script. This script takes user input, processes it, and performs the necessary calculations to determine a person's age in years, months, and days.

### `datetime` Module

The `datetime` module from Python's standard library is used to handle date and time-related operations. It enables the script to work with dates, calculate time differences, and extract various date components.

### Leap Year Calculation

To ensure accurate age calculations, the script checks for leap years using the `isleap` function from the `calendar` module. Leap years are crucial for correctly calculating the number of days in a year.

### User Input

The script prompts users to input their birthdate in the format "YYYY-MM-DD." It then converts this input into a `datetime` object for further processing.

### Age Calculation

The age calculation takes into account the current date and birthdate. It calculates the number of years, months, and days elapsed between these two dates, considering leap years and variations in the number of days in different months.

### User-Friendly Interface

The script provides a user-friendly interface, guiding users through the input process and displaying the calculated age in a clear and understandable format.

This combination of Python, the `datetime` module, leap year checking, and a user-friendly interface makes the Age Calculator a versatile tool for accurately determining a person's age.
